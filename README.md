# My SQL Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

As someone building their skills, I've found that **projects are absolutely crucial for showcasing what you can do**. That's why I created this SQL Pizza Sales Data Analysis project. My aim here was to dive deep into a pizza sales dataset, tackling a wide range of SQL queries ‚Äì from the straightforward basics right through to more advanced concepts. This project truly gave me hands-on experience, demonstrating how I approached setting up a database, importing data, writing complex queries, and interpreting the results to pull out valuable business insights.

## üçï My Project's Journey

My main objective with this project was to complete an **end-to-end data analysis on a pizza sales dataset**. I really enjoyed exploring different facets of the sales data, such as finding the total number of orders, calculating revenue, identifying popular pizza types and sizes, and spotting sales trends over time. A key part of the process was also learning how to prepare my analysis for presentation, which included creating a professional PDF report and then sharing it on platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn.

## ‚ú® Key Skills & Concepts I Explored

Through this project, I really got to grips with a comprehensive set of SQL concepts and functions, which include:

*   **Database Creation and Management**: I started by setting up a new database, which I called 'pizzahut', and then importing my data into it.
*   **Table Creation**: I manually defined table structures, carefully specifying column names, data types (like `INTEGER`, `DATE`, `TIME`, `TEXT`, `DOUBLE`), and constraints such as `NOT NULL` and `PRIMARY KEY`. This was particularly useful for handling larger datasets.
*   **Data Import**: I learned how to import CSV files into MySQL Workbench. For smaller files, the Table Data Import Wizard was perfect. However, for larger ones (over 20,000 rows, for example), I found it much more efficient to create the table structure first, then import the data into the existing table. This is generally not how it's done in the industry, but it's a valuable practice method.
*   **`SELECT` Queries**: Fundamental for retrieving specific data.
*   **`WHERE` Clause**: Essential for filtering results based on specific conditions.
*   **Aggregate Functions**: I extensively used `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()` to summarise data effectively.
*   **`GROUP BY` Clause**: Vital for grouping rows when applying aggregate functions.
*   **`ORDER BY` Clause**: Used this for sorting my query results in both ascending (`ASC`) and descending (`DESC`) order, especially when looking for top items.
*   **`JOIN` Operations**: A huge part of this project involved combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, based on common columns like `pizza_id`, `order_id`, and `pizza_type_id`. It definitely solidified my understanding of joins.
*   **`ROUND()` Function**: Handy for rounding numerical values, particularly for presentation, such as sales figures to two decimal places or average quantities to zero decimal places.
*   **`LIMIT` Clause**: Great for restricting the number of rows, especially when finding top N results.
*   **Subqueries**: I delved into embedding one SQL query within another to perform more complex operations, particularly for calculating aggregated values that were then used in outer queries. This was a bit more challenging but really rewarding.
*   **Window Functions**: I specifically used **`RANK()`** to assign a rank to each row within a partition, which was perfect for identifying top items within different pizza categories.
*   **Commenting in SQL**: I made sure to use `--` or `/* ... */` to add comments to my SQL scripts for readability and documentation.
*   **Query Beautification**: A simple but effective trick was using `CTRL + B` in MySQL Workbench to format my SQL queries, making them much easier to read.

## üìä The Data I Worked With

I worked with a **Pizza Sales dataset**, which conveniently came as four CSV files [5]. This dataset was sourced from a GitHub repository, with the link available in the video description.

The four data files I used were:
*   **`orders.csv`**: This file held information about each order, including the `order_id`, `order_date`, and `order_time`.
*   **`pizza_types.csv`**: This provided details about the different pizza types, such as `id`, `name`, `category`, and `ingredients`.
*   **`pizzas.csv`**: This contained information about individual pizzas, including `pizza_id`, `pizza_type_id`, `size` (Small, Medium, Large, XL, XXL), and `price`.
*   **`order_details.csv`**: This was crucial, containing specifics for each item in an order, like `order_details_id`, `order_id` (acting as a foreign key linking to `orders`), `pizza_id` (linking to `pizzas`), and `quantity`. I noticed the `order_id` often repeated here, indicating that multiple pizzas could be part of a single order.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies I Used

The main tools I leveraged for this analysis were:

*   **MySQL Workbench**: This was my primary SQL client for managing the database, creating tables, importing data, and executing all my queries.
*   **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: The core language, of course, for all my database interactions and data analysis.
*   **CSV (Comma Separated Values)**: The format in which my raw dataset was provided.
*   **Canva**: I found Canva really useful for creating a professional presentation (PDF) to effectively showcase my project's findings.
*   **GitHub**: I used GitHub for version control, hosting my SQL scripts, and publishing the project presentation PDF, making it easy to share my work. I also made sure to create a repository and upload the files there.
*   **LinkedIn**: A great platform for sharing my project outcomes and insights with a broader professional network.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Set Up & Executed This Project

To give you an idea of how I got this project up and running, here are the steps I followed:

1.  **Downloaded the Data**: I first obtained the `pizza_sales.zip` file from the GitHub repository link mentioned in the video description.
2.  **Extracted the Data**: I unzipped the file into a dedicated folder on my desktop, which I named "SQL Pizza Sales Project". This folder then contained the four necessary CSV data files.
3.  **Opened MySQL Workbench**: I launched MySQL Workbench.
4.  **Created the Database**: I executed the SQL query `CREATE DATABASE pizzahut;` to set up a new database specifically for this project.
5.  **Selected the Database**: I then double-clicked the newly created `pizzahut` database in the SCHEMAS panel of MySQL Workbench to make it the active database for all my subsequent operations.
6.  **Imported the Tables**:
    *   **Smaller Files (`pizzas.csv`, `pizza_types.csv`)**: For these, I used the **Table Data Import Wizard**. I right-clicked on "Tables" under my `pizzahut` database, selected "Table Data Import Wizard", browsed to my CSV file, chose "Create New Table", and confirmed the suggested data types before finishing the import.
    *   **Larger Files (`orders.csv`, `order_details.csv`)**: For the larger datasets (like `orders.csv` with over 21,000 rows), I found it essential to **first create the table structure manually** using `CREATE TABLE` statements in MySQL Workbench, defining all columns, their data types, and primary keys. After creating the empty table, I then used the "Table Data Import Wizard" and selected the option to "Use existing table" to import the CSV data into my pre-defined table structure. This was a good learning point about handling larger files.
7.  **Executed Queries**: Once all tables were imported, the fun began! I started writing and executing the SQL queries to derive insights from the data, referencing the questions provided in the `questions.txt` file (available in the GitHub repository).

## üéØ Questions I Tackled & Insights I Gained

I tackled a variety of questions to extract meaningful insights from the pizza sales data. Here are some of the key questions I addressed, moving from basic to more advanced concepts:

*   **Retrieve the total number of orders placed.**  (Output: 21,350 total orders)
*   **Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.**  (Output: 81,786.04 in total revenue)
*   **Identify the highest-priced pizza.**  (Output: The Greek Pizza)
*   **Identify the most commonly ordered pizza quantity and size.**  (Quantity: 1 is the most commonly ordered quantity. Size: Large (L) is the most commonly ordered size.)
*   **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.**  (Output: Classic Deluxe Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, Hawaiian Pizza, Pepperoni Pizza, and Thai Chicken Pizza)
*   **Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.**  (Output: Classice, Supreme, Veggie, Chicken are the top categories, with Classic being the most preferred)
*   **Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.**  (Output: The busiest hours are from 12 PM to 1 PM, and then again from 4 PM to 7 PM.)
*   **Find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.**  (Output: 6 Chicken pizzas, 8 Classic pizzas, 9 Supreme pizzas, and 9 Veggie pizzas.)
*   **Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.**  (This one involved a subquery, which was a great challenge!) (Output: An average of 138 pizzas are ordered per day.)
*   **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.**  (Output: Thai Chicken Pizza, Barbecue Chicken Pizza, and California Chicken Pizza. Interestingly, these are all from the non-vegetarian category, and the highest revenue generator (Thai Chicken) is different from the most ordered pizza type (Classic Deluxe).)
*   **Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type/category to total revenue.**  (This was an "advanced" question, combining subqueries and calculations!) (Output: Classic contributed 26.91%, Supreme 25.45%, Veggie 23.96%, and Chicken 23.68%.)
*   **Analyse the cumulative revenue generated over time.**  (I used a subquery and window function here to achieve the cumulative sum!) (Output: The cumulative revenue increased daily, showing the total revenue up to each specific date.)
*   **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.**  (This was quite complex, involving multiple subqueries and the `RANK()` window function!) (Output: Provides the top 3 pizzas by revenue for each category like Chicken, Classic, Supreme, and Veggie.)
